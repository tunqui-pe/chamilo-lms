Facebook Meet plugin
============================
This plugin allows you to have videoconference rooms in each course using Facebook Meet.
This is only a light integration, meaning you will still need to go to Facebook Meet and
have a Facebook account in order to create a meeting *and* students will need to be
connected to their Facebook account to connect. However, we believe there is still value
in making this plugin available for our community at large.
